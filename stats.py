Over the past 10 years, 16 out of the past 20 NBA finalists ranked top 5 in 2p%, 15 ranked top 5 in FG%, 12 ranked top
 5 in FG and 11 ranked top 5 in 3P. These are the 4 per game statistics which seemed to best predict the likelyhood of
 a team making the NBA Finals. The best shooting teams tend to go far in the playoffs.

 Using advanced statistics, 19 out of 20 of the past NBA finalists were top 5 in eFG%, 17 were top 5 in average Margin
 of Victory and top 5 in net rating, and 13 were top 5 in offensive rating. These metrics make it clear that a team's 
 efficiency from the field as well as their regular season dominance were conducive to reaching the NBA finals, and it
 appears as if offensive rating matters more than defensive rating.

 In recent times, teams have been obsessed with getting the most efficient shots in the playoffs, three pointers, rim
 shots, or free throws. This new emergence of statistics in basketball has taken the NBA by storm, and some fans 
 believe that maximizing efficiency during the regular season doesn't necessarily lead to playoff success. Analyzing 
 shooting statistics over the past 10 years, we find that 16 of the past 20 teams were top 5 in 2p%, 15 were top 5 in
 percentage at the rim, and 12 were top 5 in percentage from 16 ft to the 3 pt line, while 11 were top 5 in percentage
 from the 3 point line. It's clear that three point percentage isn't necessarily the main factor for winning, and that
 the midrange game is still important in the playoffs. 

 We will be using 2p%, FG%, 3P, eFG%, Net RTG, margin of victory, offensive rating, percentage at the rim, and 
 percentage from 16 ft - 3 pt line in our model to predict the NBA champion.
